Why chat with one GPT when you can chat with two? Or, better yet, have them chat with each other with you as the moderator?

That's the idea behind Red v Blue. It's a chat app that uses two large language models to chat with each other, but you stay in control of the conversation.

Set up a conversation between two AIs, each with their own directives, then seed the conversation with a starting prompt (as one of them), then generate the response from the other. You have a chance to edit that response before sending it back to the first AI, and so on.

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
